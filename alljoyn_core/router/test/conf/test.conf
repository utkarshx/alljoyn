  <!-- This configuration file controls the systemwide message bus.
       Add a system-local.conf and edit that rather than changing this
       file directly. -->

  <!-- Note that there are any number of ways you can hose yourself
       security-wise by screwing up this file; in particular, you
       probably don't want to listen on any more addresses, add any more
       auth mechanisms, run as a different user, etc. -->

       means use abstract namespace, don't really create filesystem
       file; only Linux supports this. Use path=/whatever on other
       systems.) -->
