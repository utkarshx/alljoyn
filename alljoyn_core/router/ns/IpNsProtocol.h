 * @defgroup name_service_protocol Name Service Protocol
 * @{
 * <b>Introduction</b>
 *
 * One goal of AllJoyn is to allow clients of the bus to make Remote Procedure Calls
 * (RPC) or receive Signals from physically remote obejcts connected to the
 * bus as if they were local.  Collections of RCP and Signal signatures,
 * typically called interfaces.  Bus attachments are collections of interface
 * implementations and are described by so-called well-known or bus names.
 * Groups of one or more bus attachments are coordinated by AllJoyn daemon
 * processes that run on each host.  Physically or logically distributed AllJoyn
 * daemons may be merged into a single virtual bus.
 *
 * One of the fundamental issues in distributing processes across different
 * hosts is the discovering the address and port of a given service.  In the
 * case of AllJoyn, the communication endpoints of the various daemon processes
 * must be located so communication paths may be established.  This lightweight
 * name service protocol provides a definition of a protocol for such a
 * process.
 *
 * <b>Transport</b>
 *
 * Name service protocol messages are expected to be transported
 * over UDP, typically over a well-known multicast group and port.  A
 * UDP datagram carrying a name service message would appear like,
 *
 * @verbatim

 *
 * <b>Strings</b>
 *
 * Since well-known names are strings, one of the fundamental objects in
 * the protocol is the StringData object.  Strings are encoded an octet
 * giving the length of the string, followed by some number UTF-8 characters.
 * (no terminating zero is required)  For example, the string "STRING"
 * would be encoded as follows.  The single octet length means that the
 * longest string possible is 255 characters.  This should not prove to
 * be a problem since it is the same maximum length as a domain name, on
 * which bus names are modeled.
 *

 *
 * <b>IS-AT Message</b>
 *
 * The IS-AT message is an "answer" message used to advertise the existence
 * of a number of bus names on a given AllJoyn daemon.  IS-AT messages can
 * be sent as part of a response to a question, or they can be sent
 * gratuitously when an AllJoyn daemon decides to export the fact that it
 * supports some number of bus names.

 *
 * <b>Version 1</b>
 *
 * Version one of the protocol extends version zero to include the type of the
 * transport that is doing the advertisement and admit the possibility of
 * reliable and unreliable transports over both IPv4 and IPv6.
 *
 * The most general form of an advertisement containing this information includes
 * Four address/port pairs:
 *
 *     R4: IPv4 address, port of a TCP-based endpoint present;
 *     U4: IPv4 address, port of a UDP-based endpoint present;
 *     R6: IPv6 address, port of a TCP-based endpoint present;
 *     U6: IPv6 address, port of a UDP-based endpoint present.
 *
 * One can contemplate various optimizations which would allow us to elide
 * addresses in some case, but the complexity of managing such optimizations is
 * such that we do the simple thing and send a complete endpoint description for
 * every endpoint.  It is the most general case and if we were able to optimize
 * all four addresses out we are talking about forty bytes.  The code complexity
 * just doesn't seem worth it; and so the four cases above replace the F, S, U,
 * T bits of the version zero protocol.
 *
 * Since the port is now associated to the provided addresses, the port field in the version
 * zero is-at message becomes a TransportMask which indicates the AllJoyn transport that is making the
 * advertisement.

 * <b>Example</b>
 *
 * It is expected that when an AllJoyn daemon comes up, it will want to advertise
 * the fact that it is up and supports some number of bus names.  It may also
 * be the case that the AllJoyn daemon already knows that it will need to find
 * some remote bus names when it comes up.  In this case, it can send an initial
 * message that both announces its bus names, and asks for any other AllJoyn
 * daemons that support what it wants.
 *
 * Consider a daemon that is capable of dealing with IPv4 addresses, and is
 * listening on Port 9955 of IPv4 address "192.168.10.10" for incoming
 * connections.  If the daemon is interested in locating another daemons that
 * supports the bus name "org.yadda.foo" and wants to export the fact that it
 * supports the bus name, "org.yadda.bar", and will support than name forever,
 * it might send a packet that combines WHO-HAS and IS-AT messages and that
 * looks something like

     * protocol version.
     *
     * If a new version of the protocol is defined, new senders will be modified
     * to generate the new version, and new receivers will be able to receive
     * new messages.  The message version tells a receiver what the absolute
     * format of the current message is; and the sender protocol version
     * provides a context shared between the sender and the receiver that can
     * indicate more, or better, information may be forthcoming.
     *
     * The message version tells "this" object which version of the wire
     * protocol to use when serializing the bits and which version to expect
     * when deserializing the bits.  The sender protocol version is meta-data

     * The name service protocol is versioned.  For backward compatibility, we
     * need to be able to get down-version messages to "old" daemons and current
     * version messages to "new" daemons.  The first thing to observe is that,
     * like most protocols, the wire protocol is versioned, not extensible.
     * This means that in order to support multiple versions, we will need to
     * send multiple messages.  This introduces ambiguitiy in the receiver of
     * the messages since it cannot know whether or not "new" messages will
     * appear after 'old" ones.  To resolve this ambiguity, the wire protocol
     * version is constructed of two versions:  a message version and a sender
     * protocol version.
     *
     * If a new version of the protocol is defined, new senders will be modified
     * to generate the new version, and new receivers will be able to receive
     * new messages.  The message version tells a receiver what the absolute
     * format of the current message is; and the sender protocol version
     * provides a context shared between the sender and the receiver that can
     * indicate more, or better, information may be forthcoming.
     *
     * The message version tells "this" object which version of the wire
     * protocol to use when serializing the bits and which version to expect
     * when deserializing the bits.  The sender protocol version is meta-data
     * for higher level code.
     *
     * The version is found in the Header, so we will know for sure what version
     * the overall packet will take.  Objects of class IsAt support all versions
     * known at the time of compilation.  If the version of the wire protocol
     * read does not provide a value for a given field, a default value will be
     * provided.  Objects of class IsAt can support writing down-version packets
     * for compatibility.

     * version messages to "new" daemons.  The first thing to observe is that,
     * like most protocols, the wire protocol is versioned, not extensible.
     * This means that in order to support multiple versions, we will need to
     * send multiple messages.  This introduces ambiguitiy in the receiver of
     * the messages since it cannot know whether or not "new" messages will
     * appear after 'old" ones.  To resolve this ambiguity, the wire protocol
     * version is constructed of two versions:  a message version and a sender
     * protocol version.
     *
     * If a new version of the protocol is defined, new senders will be modified
     * to generate the new version, and new receivers will be able to receive
     * new messages.  The message version tells a receiver what the absolute
     * format of the current message is; and the sender protocol version
     * provides a context shared between the sender and the receiver that can
     * indicate more, or better, information may be forthcoming.
     *
     * The message version tells "this" object which version of the wire
     * protocol to use when serializing the bits and which version to expect
     * when deserializing the bits.  The sender protocol version is meta-data
     * for higher level code.
     *
     * The version is found in the Header, so we will know for sure what version
     * the overall packet will take.  Objects of class IsAt support all versions
     * known at the time of compilation.  If the version of the wire protocol
     * read does not provide a value for a given field, a default value will be
     * provided.  Objects of class IsAt can support writing down-version packets
     * for compatibility.
