BusAttachment.removeSessionMember(int sessionId, String sessionMemberName)
    Remove a session member from an existing multipoint session.

    This method is a shortcut/helper that issues an
    org.alljoyn.Bus.RemoveSessionMember method call to the local daemon
    and interprets the response.

    [param] sessionId - Session id.
    [param] sessionMemberName - Name of member to remove from session.

NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.registerBusObject(BusObject busObj, String objPath, boolean secure)
    Registers a bus object.

    Once registered, the bus object may communicate to and from other
    objects via its implemented bus interfaces.

    The same object may not be registered on multiple bus connections.
    [param] busObj - the BusObject to register
    [param] objPath - the object path of the BusObject
    [param] secure - true if authentication is required to access this object

    Creates a proxy bus object for a remote bus object.
    Methods on the remote object can be invoked through the proxy object.

    There is no guarantee that the remote object referred to by the proxy
    acutally exists.  If the remote object does not exist, proxy method calls
    will fail.

    Java proxy classes do not allow methods from two different interfaces to
    have the same name and calling parameters. If two AllJoyn methods from two
    different interfaces are implemented by the same remote object, one (or
    both) of the method names must be modified. You may then use an annotation
    for the renamed method to cause AllJoyn to use the originally expected
    method name in any "wire" operations.

    [param] busName - the remote endpoint name (well-known or unique)
    [param] objPath - the absolute (non-relative) object path for the object
    [param] sessionId - the session corresponding to the connection to the the
                        object
    [param] busInterfaces - an array of BusInterfaces that this proxy should
                            respond to

            even when implemented by a secure object.
      - inherit if the Secure annotation is omitted the interface will use a
                security of inherit.  If security is inherit or security is not
                specified for an interface the interface inherits the security
                of the objects that implements the interface.
    if an unknown value is given inherit will be used

                security of inherit.  If security is inherit or security is not
                specified for an interface the interface inherits the security
                of the objects that implements the interface.
    if an unknown value is given inherit will be used

BusAttachment.emitChangedSignal(BusObject busObject, 
                                String ifcName, 
                                String propName,

                                int sessionId)
    Emit PropertiesChanged to signal the bus that this property has been updated
    [param] busObject - The BusObject that is the source of this signal
    [param] ifcName   - The name of the interface
    [param] propName  - The name of the property being changed
    [param] val       - The new value of the property
    [param] sessionId - Id of the session we broadcast to (0 for all)

    
NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.enableConcurrentCallbacks()
    Enable callbacks within the context of the currently executing method
    handler, signal handler or other AllJoyn callback.
    
    This method can ONLY be called from within the body of a signal handler,
    method handler or other AllJoyn callback. It allows AllJoyn to dispatch 
    a single (additional) callback while the current one is still executing.
    This method is typically used when a method, signal handler or other
    AllJoyn callback needs to execute for a long period of time or when the 
    callback needs to make any kind of blocking call.
    
    This method MUST be called prior to making any non-asynchronous AllJoyn 
    remote procedure calls from within an AllJoyn callback. This includes
    calls such as joinSession(), advertiseName(), cancelAdvertisedName(),
    findAdvertisedName(), cancelFindAdvertisedName(), setLinkTimeout(), etc.


NEW METHOD
BusListener.busDisconnected()
    Called when a BusAttachment this listener is registered with is has become

    Any implementation of this function must be multithread safe.  See the
    class documentation for details.
    [param] propName  - The well-known name that has changed.
    [param] propValue - The new value of the property; NULL if not present

NEW LISTENER

AllJoyn API Changes between v2.1.0 and v2.2.0 (Java API)
NEW CLASS
Class ExpirationRequest added to AuthListener
    ExpirationRequest.setExpiration(int expiration)
        Sets an expiration time in seconds relative to the current time for
        the credentials. This value is optional and can be set on any
        response to a credentials request. After the specified expiration
        time has elapsed any secret keys based on the provided credentials
        are invalidated and a new authentication exchange will be
        required. If an expiration is not set the default expiration time for
        the requested authentication mechanism is used.
        [param] expiration - the expiration time in seconds

CHANGED METHOD
BusAttachment.joinSession(string, short, SessionOpts, SessionListener, OnJoinSessionListener, context)
    Asynchronous version of joinSession(string, short, Mutable.IntegerValue, SessionOpts, SessionListener)}.
    context param added in 2.2 release 
    [param] context - User-defined context object.  Passed through to OnJoinSessionListener.onJoinSession(Status, int, SessionOpts, Object).
    
NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.setLinkTimeout(int sessionId, Mutable.IntegerValue linkTimeout)
    Set the link timeout for a session.
    
    Link timeout is the maximum number of seconds that an unresponsive
    daemon-to-daemon connection will be monitored before declaring the
    session lost (via SessionLost callback). Link timeout defaults to 0 which
    indicates that AllJoyn link monitoring is disabled.
    
    Each transport type defines a lower bound on link timeout to avoid
    defeating transport specific power management algorithms.
    
    [param] sessionId   - Id of session whose link timeout will be modified.
    [param] linkTimeout - [IN/OUT] Max number of seconds that a link can be
                          unresponsive before being declared lost. 0 indicates
                          that AllJoyn link monitoring will be disabled. On
                          return, this value will be the resulting (possibly
                          upward) adjusted linkTimeout value that acceptable
                          to the underlying transport.

 NEW METHOD
 BusAttachment.release()
    Release resources immediately.
    
    Normally, when all references are removed to a given object, the Java
    garbage collector notices the fact that the object is no longer required
    and will destroy it.  This can happen at the garbage collector's leisure
    an so any resources held by the object will not be released until "some
    time later" after the object is no longer needed.
    
    Often, in test programs, we cycle through many BusAttachments in a very
    short time, and if we rely on the garbage collector to clean up, we can
    fairly quickly run out of scarce underlying resources -- especially file
    descriptors.
    
    We provide an explicitly release() method to allow test programs to release
    the underlying resources immediately.  The garbage collector will still
    call finalize, but the resources held by the underlying C++ objects will
    go away immediately.
    
    It is a programming error to call another method on the BusAttachment
    after the release() method has been called.
    
NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.setKeyExpiration(String guid, int timeout)
    Sets the expiration time on keys associated with a specific remote peer as identified by its
    peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by calling
    getPeerGUID(String, Mutable.StringValue).  If the timeout is 0 this is equivalent to calling
    clearKeys(String).
    
    [param] guid    - the GUID of a remote authenticated peer
    [param] timeout - the time in seconds relative to the current time to expire the keys

NEW METHOD
BusAttachment.getKeyExpiration(String guid, Mutable.IntegerValue timeout)
    Gets the expiration time on keys associated with a specific authenticated remote peer as
    identified by its peer GUID. The peer GUID associated with a bus name can be obtained by
    calling getPeerGUID(String, Mutable.StringValue).
    
    [param] guid    - the GUID of a remote authenticated peer
    [param] timeout - the time in seconds relative to the current time when the keys will expire

CHANGED METHOD
InterfaceDescription.addMember(int type, String name, String inputSig, String outSig, int annotation, String accessPerm)
    param accessPerm added for 2.2.0 release
    
NEW METHOD
ProxyBusObject.release()
    Release resources immediately.
     
    Normally, when all references are removed to a given object, the Java
    garbage collector notices the fact that the object is no longer required
    and will destory it.  This can happen at the garbage collector's leisure
    an so any resources held by the object will not be released until "some
    time later" after the object is no longer needed.

    It is a programming error to call another method on the ProxyBusObject
    after the release() method has been called.

NEW METHOD
SessionListener.sessionMemberAdded(int sessionId, String uniqueName)
    Called by the bus for multipoint sessions when another node joins the session.
    
    [param] sessionId  - Id of multipoint session whose members have changed.
    [param] uniqueName - Unique name of member who joined the session.

NEW METHOD
SessionListener.sessionMemberRemoved(int sessionId, String uniqueName)
    Called by the bus for multipoint sessions when another node leaves the session.
    
    [param] sessionId  - Id of multipoint session whose members have changed.
    [param] uniqueName - Unique name of member who left the session.
